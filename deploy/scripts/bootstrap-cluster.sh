# deploy/scripts/bootstrap-cluster.sh
#
# Bootstraps the AISPM Kubernetes stack on a running cluster (kind for
# local dev — see deploy/scripts/kind-cluster.sh; kubeadm/GKE/EKS for
# staging/prod).  The script assumes kubectl can reach a cluster —
# that's the whole premise. If you don't have a cluster, this isn't
# the script you're looking for.
#
# ── INVARIANTS LEARNED THE HARD WAY ─────────────────────────────────────────
# Each item below cost real debugging time. Re-read the corresponding
# template comment before touching any of them.
#
#   1. Kafka, Redis, Postgres pods MUST carry `sidecar.istio.io/inject:
#      "false"` on their pod template. Envoy's L4 proxy mangles binary
#      protocols on the initial handshake — surfaces as
#      `UnrecognizedBrokerVersion` (Kafka), `Connection closed by server.`
#      (Redis), or empty replies (Postgres). See
#      templates/kafka-statefulset.yaml, redis-statefulset.yaml,
#      spm-db-statefulset.yaml.
#
#   2. KAFKA_BOOTSTRAP_SERVERS / KAFKA_REPLICATION_FACTOR /
#      KAFKA_MIN_INSYNC_REPLICAS are derived from .Values.kafka.replicas
#      in templates/configmap-platform-env.yaml — never hardcode them.
#      A static 3-broker list crashes single-broker dev with
#      `[Errno -2] Name or service not known` for kafka-1/-2.
#
#   3. The startup-orchestrator pins KafkaAdminClient(api_version=(2,5,0))
#      so kafka-python-ng skips broker-version probing — Confluent 7.6
#      only supports ApiVersionsRequest 0..3 and the probe-fall-back
#      logic raises UnrecognizedBrokerVersion against newer clients.
#
#   4. db-seed runs `Base.metadata.create_all` BEFORE inserting rows.
#      Multiple platform services (api, agent-orchestrator, garak,
#      threat-hunting-agent, guard_model) call hydrate_env_from_db() at
#      module-import time; without the schema in place by Phase 4 they
#      crash before lifespan can create it.
#
#   5. The spm-api Dockerfile MUST COPY both seed_db.py AND
#      posture_routes.py into /app. Either missing → db-seed Job fails
#      with "can't open file '/app/seed_db.py'" or Posture page 404s.
#
#   6. AuthorizationPolicies that match `source.namespaces` only allow
#      mTLS-identified callers. Sidecar-less Jobs (orchestrator, db-seed)
#      need an additional rule that matches by HTTP method/path,
#      otherwise Envoy returns "RBAC: access denied". See
#      opa-allow-platform in istio-authorizationpolicies.yaml.
#
#   7. Public API paths surfaced through the gateway must be listed in
#      the spm-api-allow path rule. Adding a new top-level UI route
#      means adding a new entry to that list. Current set:
#      /healthz /docs /openapi.json /models* /posture* /integrations*
#      /policies* /agents* /findings* /dashboard* /auth* /llm*
#
#   8. Any AuthorizationPolicy that selects a workload reachable from
#      both agents and platform (spm-mcp, spm-llm-proxy) must have BOTH
#      a rule for the agents namespace AND a rule for the platform
#      namespace. Symptoms when missing: integration test connections
#      fail, agent chat returns "403 ... RBAC: access denied".
#
#   9. Service ports serving HTTP MUST be `name: http` with
#      `appProtocol: HTTP`. Istio uses the name to attach HTTP-aware
#      filters; an unnamed port is treated as plain TCP and path-based
#      AuthZ rules silently never match.
#
#  10. Flink HA PVCs (flink-checkpoints, flink-ha) are RWX in prod, RWO
#      in dev. local-path doesn't support RWX and rejects bindings
#      outright (not just at mount). values.dev.yaml overrides
#      flink.sharedAccessMode=ReadWriteOnce + jobmanager.replicas=1.
#
#  11. The aispm-agents namespace is labeled
#      `istio.io/dataplane-mode=ambient`, but Istio's ztunnel DaemonSet
#      isn't installed by default. Without ztunnel, ambient pods send
#      plain HTTP with no peer identity. Any AuthorizationPolicy that
#      relies on `source.namespaces` or `source.principals` for the
#      agent path will deny — symptom: agent chat returns "RBAC: access
#      denied" calling spm-llm-proxy or spm-mcp.
#      Workaround applied: path-based ALLOW rules on spm-llm-proxy and
#      spm-mcp restricted to specific operation paths (e.g.
#      /v1/chat/completions, /v1/models). The app's own LLM_API_KEY /
#      MCP_TOKEN are the actual trust boundary; Istio is defense-in-depth.
#      Long-term proper fix: install ztunnel.
#
#  12. ALWAYS rebuild the spm-api and startup-orchestrator images on
#      bootstrap (Step 3). They contain code that's tightly coupled to
#      chart changes:
#        - seed_db.py owns schema creation (invariant 4) — out-of-date
#          image misses tables that platform services need on import.
#        - startup_orchestrator/app.py pins kafka api_version (invariant 3)
#          — out-of-date image fails Step 2 with UnrecognizedBrokerVersion.
#
#  13. cert-manager's selfsigned cert breaks WebSocket connections in
#      browsers. HTTPS pages can be clicked through ("Advanced → Continue
#      anyway"), but WSS has no such dialog — Safari/Chrome silently
#      drop the upgrade. Symptom: Simulator/Chat pages stuck on "Waiting
#      for probe results" while api logs spam `ws_buffer_full — dropping
#      oldest`.
#
#      Dev (`values.dev.yaml: ingress.certManager: false`): Step 2 of
#      this script auto-runs mkcert to mint a browser-trusted cert and
#      upserts it into istio-system/aispm-tls + aispm/aispm-tls. The
#      mkcert root CA gets added to the OS keychain on first run (sudo
#      prompt). To skip the automation (CI / headless): set SKIP_MKCERT=1
#      and manage the secret yourself.
#
#      Prereq: `brew install mkcert` (preflight warns if missing).
#
#      Prod (`values.yaml: ingress.certManager: true`): cert-manager
#      issues + renews via ACME / Let's Encrypt. Browsers trust the chain
#      out of the box, no mkcert needed.
#
#  14. GARAK_INTERNAL_SECRET / SPM_INTERNAL_BOOTSTRAP_SECRET MUST be
#      non-empty in platform-secrets. If empty, services/garak/main.py
#      falls back to garak's `Blank` generator (synthetic empty prompts),
#      so the Simulator runs every probe with no actual content to flag
#      and every result returns "allowed" — looks like the guardrails are
#      broken. Step 2 of this script auto-generates random values for
#      both via `openssl rand -hex 24` if neither the env nor .env
#      supplied one, and preserves whatever's already in the Secret on
#      re-runs so existing sessions stay decodable.
#
#  15. LlamaGuard escalation threshold (`GUARD_BLOCK_SCORE`) controls
#      when an `allow` verdict-with-categories gets escalated to a block.
#      Default 0.6 is prod-tuned (low false-positive rate); dev
#      (values.dev.yaml) overrides to 0.3 so the Simulator catches
#      borderline jailbreaks (score ~0.30). If the "Allowed" counter on
#      the Simulation Lab shows non-zero hits on probes you expect to be
#      blocked, this knob is the lever.
#
#  16. guard-model has TWO failure modes. The LLM-call path requires
#      `GROQ_BASE_URL` (any OpenAI-compatible URL — set by the Ollama /
#      Groq integration in the UI, despite the env var name). When
#      unreachable, the service falls through to a regex classifier
#      that doesn't recognize obfuscated content (`ign-ore pre-vious
#      in-struc-tions`) and silently allows it. The dev fix is two env
#      knobs both set in values.dev.yaml's `platformEnv`:
#        GUARD_FAIL_CLOSED=1   — return block instead of regex on LLM
#                                failure (fail-loud rather than silent)
#        GROQ_BASE_URL/_MODEL  — point guard-model at Ollama llama-guard3
#                                so the LLM call actually succeeds
#      Prereq on the host: `ollama pull llama-guard3`. In prod,
#      GUARD_FAIL_CLOSED stays default-off and the LLM is pointed at
#      hosted Groq with a real API key.
#
#  22. The agent-orchestrator-service's default DB_PATH must point under
#      DataVolumes/agent-orchestrator/, NOT at the repo root. The
#      previous default ("agent_orchestrator.db") is a relative path,
#      so anyone running `python main.py` from the repo root drops a
#      stray SQLite file at the repo root that leaks across branches.
#      Fix in main.py: _DEFAULT_DB_PATH resolves an absolute path to
#      ../../DataVolumes/agent-orchestrator/ alongside the other
#      persistent dev-only state. Compose and k8s set DB_PATH=/data/...
#      explicitly via env, so this default only matters out of Docker.
#
#  21. The chat-runtime event types (AgentChatMessage, AgentLLMCall,
#      AgentToolCall) MUST be registered in two places to render
#      correctly in the UI:
#        a) services/agent-orchestrator-service/schemas/events.py —
#           the EventType(str, Enum) class. Without an enum entry,
#           get_events() in session_service.py coerces the type to
#           EventType.UNKNOWN and the UI shows "unknown" for every
#           chat event title and description.
#        b) ui/src/lib/sessionResults.js — the _RAW_TO_CANONICAL map
#           plus the canonicalise() role-split for AgentChatMessage
#           (role=user → SESSION_STARTED, role=agent → OUTPUT_GENERATED).
#           Without these, the lineage graph's switch statement never
#           matches, no nodes are added, and the Lineage page is empty
#           even though session_events has rows.
#      Symptom of regression: chat works end-to-end, agent_sessions /
#      session_events populate in the orchestrator's SQLite, but the
#      Runtime page shows "unknown / Prompt / unknown" rows and the
#      Lineage page renders an empty graph.
#
#  20. Kafka StatefulSet readiness probe needs `timeoutSeconds: 5`,
#      not the kubelet default of 1. The probe is an exec of
#      `kafka-broker-api-versions --bootstrap-server localhost:9092`,
#      which spins up a JVM client + opens a TCP connection. Under
#      modest load (e.g. Flink CEP transaction-coordinator inits)
#      that takes 2-3s; with timeoutSeconds=1 the probe falsely
#      fails, k8s flips the pod NotReady, the headless DNS entry
#      drops, and any caller doing a fresh `kafka-0.kafka...`
#      lookup (per-request producers in spm-api's chat path) gets
#      NXDOMAIN until the next probe pass. Symptom: chat returns
#      "Load failed" with `KafkaConnectionError: Unable to bootstrap
#      from kafka-0...` in spm-api logs even though kafka itself is
#      alive. Fix lives in templates/kafka-statefulset.yaml.
#      timeoutSeconds=5 keeps the probe responsive enough to catch
#      real broker hangs (failureThreshold=10 still gives 50s grace
#      before NotReady) without false-flagging brief load spikes.
#
#  19. Deployments' readiness probes must point at a port the workload
#      actually listens on. spm-aggregator originally specified
#      `httpGet: /health on :8080` but the workload only ever exposed
#      Prometheus on :9091 — readiness probe always failed, the pod
#      sat at 1/2 Running, and rollouts timed out. The fix is in the
#      chart: probe at /metrics on 9091. If you add new headless
#      services, audit their readinessProbe before declaring victory.
#
#  18. spm-aggregator's psycopg2 connections need TCP keepalives. On a
#      quiet dev cluster, postgres connections sit idle for hours
#      between Kafka audit events; without keepalives the kernel /
#      firewall silently drops the socket and the next message hits
#      `psycopg2.InterfaceError: connection already closed`. The audit
#      event is then lost (the except-handler reconnects, but the
#      previous message is gone). Symptom: Runtime page in the UI
#      shows nothing for recent agent activity even though Kafka has
#      the events. Fix: get_db_conn() now passes
#      keepalives_idle=30 keepalives_interval=10 keepalives_count=3.
#
#  17. The obfuscation_screen at services/api/models/obfuscation_screen.py
#      is the catch-all for character-insertion / punctuation-broken
#      jailbreaks (`Ign-ore pre-vious in-struc-tions`, `i.g.n.o.r.e`).
#      LlamaGuard 3 is OUT OF DOMAIN for prompt-injection (its taxonomy
#      covers content safety, not instruction override), so LlamaGuard
#      alone returns allow on these and the regression surfaces as
#      Simulator probes passing with score=0. The `punctuation_injection`
#      rule (Step 6 in screen_obfuscation) drops every non-letter
#      character then matches against an attack-phrase list. If the
#      Simulator allows obfuscated jailbreaks, that's the rule that
#      needs a phrase added — not LlamaGuard that needs retuning.

# ── 6. Render + phased apply of the AISPM chart ──────────────────────────
# We do `helm template | split-by-tier.py | kubectl apply` rather than a
# single `kubectl apply` so we can gate each phase on the previous one
# being Ready. The order — data → data-init → platform → compute →
# compute-init → frontend — encodes the rough dependency DAG: data plane
# first, seeded, before any service that talks to it; compute plane after
# data; UI last.
#
# `helm template` (not `helm upgrade`) is chosen because:
#   - Lets us pass --api-versions explicitly so all CRD-conditional
#     templates render on a fresh install where the CRDs were just added
#     in the same script run.
#   - kubectl apply tolerates partial resources better than helm release
#     tracking on a dev cluster that gets reset frequently.
#   - PVC / StatefulSet data persists across runs because kubectl apply
#     never touches them on update.

  #      the logs survive even after the pod is GC'd
  #   2. waits for rollout

  #      pod logs inline so we don't need a follow-up round-trip

  # ── 8d. TLS cert chain (invariant 13) — ACTIVE REPAIR ─────────────
  # Browsers refuse WSS connections to self-signed certs even after the
  # user clicks through HTTPS warnings.  Dev uses mkcert (root CA added
  # to the OS keychain by `mkcert -install`); the istio-system/aispm-tls
  # Secret should be populated with that cert, NOT with cert-manager's
  # self-signed one.
  #
  # Until May 2026 this section only WARNED — and cert-manager kept
  # overwriting our mkcert Secret on every chart re-apply, so WSS
  # would break again every bootstrap.  Now this section actively
  # repairs the chain in place:
  #   (a) delete any cert-manager Certificate that would re-stamp the
  #       Secret on the next reconcile,
  #   (b) re-upsert the mkcert Secret from keys/aispm-tls.{crt,key},
  #   (c) restart istio-ingressgateway so SDS reloads the new cert,
  #   (d) verify the wire-issuer is mkcert and warn if not.
