garak_runner.py
───────────────
Garak simulation engine that produces SimulationEvents.

Garak (https://github.com/NVIDIA/garak) is a probe-based LLM red-teaming
framework. This module wraps its lifecycle and emits SimulationEvent objects
via an injected ``emit_event`` callable so the output flows through the
existing pipeline unchanged:

  POST /simulate/garak
    → _run_garak (simulation.py)
      → run_garak_simulation (this module)
        → emit_event (WS + optional Kafka)
          → ConnectionManager.broadcast
            → WebSocket → useSimulationState → Timeline → ResultsPanel

Full execution trace
────────────────────
In addition to probe-level lifecycle events, this module emits a per-attempt
execution trace that gives complete visibility into every step:

  Trace event type   Meaning
  ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  llm.prompt         Exact prompt text sent to the model
  llm.response       Raw model output for that attempt
  guard.decision     Guard/detector verdict (allow|block + reason + score)
  tool.call          Tool invoked by a probe (optional; Garak-specific)

These events carry the same correlation_id as the surrounding
simulation.progress / simulation.blocked|allowed events so the frontend
and any downstream lineage system can link: probe → prompt → response →
guard decision → finding.

Event mapping
─────────────
  Garak lifecycle         →  SimulationEvent type          Notes
  ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  start                   →  simulation.started
  probe running           →  simulation.progress           step + probe_name
  lineage                 →  lineage.node                  UI ignores unknown types
  per-attempt prompt      →  llm.prompt                    full trace
  per-attempt response    →  llm.response                  full trace
  per-attempt guard       →  guard.decision                full trace
  tool invoked (optional) →  tool.call                     full trace
  finding (high/critical) →  simulation.blocked            adds to partialResults
  finding (≤medium)       →  simulation.allowed            adds to partialResults
  all probes done         →  simulation.completed          terminal — ends the run
  any exception           →  simulation.error              terminal — ends the run

Terminal guarantee
──────────────────
EXACTLY ONE of simulation.completed or simulation.error is ALWAYS emitted,
even if individual probes crash or the coroutine is cancelled by asyncio.
This is enforced by the try/except/finally pattern in run_garak_simulation,
with the outer _run_with_hard_timeout wrapper in routes/simulation.py as an
additional safety net.

Garak library availability
───────────────────────────
garak is a REQUIRED dependency (see requirements.txt).  The service will not
start if garak is not installed.  A lightweight stub (_run_probe_stub) is
retained for testing purposes only — it is not used in production because
_garak_available() raises RuntimeError when garak is absent.

            # lineage.node to this probe run.  But every attempt within a probe
            # is its own end-to-end trace (prompt → response → guard decision →
            # terminal), and the frontend joins those events by correlation_id
            # in useSimulationStream (dedup key `cid:<canonical>:<corr>`) and in
            # buildAttemptsFromEvents (prompt/response/guard maps keyed on cid).

            # If ALL attempts of a probe share the same correlation_id, only

            # subsequent attempt's prompt/response overwrites its predecessor

            # attempt; post-fix-D we key on canonical+cid only, so the bug
            # surfaced.
