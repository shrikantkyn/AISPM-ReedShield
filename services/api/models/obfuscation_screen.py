────────────────────────────
Detects encoding / obfuscation tricks used to smuggle malicious payloads
past text-based safety classifiers.

Returns (blocked: bool, label: Optional[str]) — same contract as screen_lexical.
No external dependencies beyond the Python standard library.

Checks (in order, first match wins):
  1. Unicode format / invisible characters  (Cf category — RLO, zero-width, etc.)
  2. Base64-encoded printable payload       (≥ 20 decoded bytes)
  3. Hex-encoded payload                    (≥ 8 hex pairs)
  4. ROT13-encoded attack phrases
  5. Leetspeak-normalised attack phrases
