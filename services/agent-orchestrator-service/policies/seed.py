      PII-Mask, etc.) used only for UI demos.  Phase 1 swaps that for
      the real OPA policies bundled from the chart's
      ``files/policies/*.rego``.  But ``seed_policies`` short-circuits
      when the table is non-empty, so on existing dev clusters the mock
      rows would block the real seed.

      Pruning is keyed strictly on the mock ID list — any user-created
      policy whose ID happens not to be in that set is left alone.

    Returns the count of rows updated.

    Why this exists:
      The Phase 1 seed only runs when the policies table is empty.  Once
      it's populated, every subsequent restart short-circuits.  That's
      idempotent in the happy path, but it leaks one specific class of
      bug: if a single .rego file was empty / unreadable / incomplete
      during the very first seed, its row carries the empty value
      forever.  We hit exactly this with ``pii_policy-v1`` — its row
      was inserted with logic_code='' on an early deploy and the
      idempotent seed never re-ran to fix it.

      This reconciliation step closes the loop.  Each startup compares
      every real-policy row's ``logic_code`` against the bundled file's
      current content; any mismatch is updated in place.  ``user-edited
      policies'' (those whose IDs aren't in the bundled set) are never
      touched.

    Operationally idempotent — when bundle and DB match, this does N
    SELECTs and zero writes, finishing in <50ms even with hundreds of
    policies.  Logs a warning per update so operators see when self-
    heal kicks in.
