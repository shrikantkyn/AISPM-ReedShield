Business logic for policy validation and simulation.

Validation: combination of (a) OPA /v1/policies authoritative compile
when OPA is reachable, and (b) regex-based static checks as a
fall-through when OPA is offline. Fully deterministic given the same
input + OPA reachability.

Simulation: stateless deterministic mock — inspects policy data and the
provided input dict, no external calls. Phase 3 will swap this for real
OPA /v1/data evaluation; for now the mock keeps the UI functional.

    upload doesn't collide with an already-loaded copy of the same
    package in OPA.

    Why: validate / simulate both upload the EDITED policy under a
    temporary OPA policy ID (e.g. ``_validate_a1b2c3d4``) so we can
    compile-check or evaluate it without touching the live runtime
    copy.  But OPA stores policies by ID *and* compiles the union of
    all uploaded modules — so two modules under different IDs that
    declare the same package + ``default allow := X`` rule collide
    with::

        rego_type_error: multiple default rules data.<pkg>.allow found

    Renaming our temp upload's package to ``<sandbox_prefix>.<orig_pkg>``
    isolates it cleanly: the temp upload lives at
    ``data._validate_<rand>.ai.security.jailbreak_detect``, the runtime
    copy stays at ``data.ai.security.jailbreak_detect``, no overlap, no
    collision.

    Returns ``(rewritten_code, original_pkg)``.  ``original_pkg`` is the
    pre-rewrite package path, which simulate uses to compute the data
    API URL.  Returns ``(code, None)`` unchanged if no package
    declaration is present.

    Cross-policy imports are left untouched: ``prompt_policy.rego``
    keeps its ``import data.ai.security.recon_guard`` so it can still
    pull from OTHER policies' runtime copies.  Only the module-defining
    ``package`` line is rewritten.

    """Send Rego source to OPA's /v1/policies API for real compile-time
    validation. Returns (errors, warnings) — empty lists when valid.

    Why call OPA instead of doing more regex: Rego is a non-trivial
    language with type inference, dataset references, regex patterns,
    function arity, and a real compiler. Regex-based checks miss
    everything except gross syntactic issues — they pass code that's
    obviously broken (mismatched parens inside string literals look
    "balanced", undefined references look fine, wrong rule heads pass
    silently). Operators editing a policy in the UI need real feedback
    about whether the policy actually compiles.

    OPA's PUT /v1/policies/{id} endpoint returns:
      - 200 OK with empty body on success
      - 400 with JSON body containing the parse/compile errors and their
        line numbers when the policy fails.

    We use a temporary policy ID prefixed with "_validate_" so this never
    collides with a real policy in the OPA instance, and we DELETE it
    immediately after the validation call so OPA doesn't accumulate
    abandoned validate-only policies over time.

    Network failure is non-fatal — falls back to regex checks. The UI
    sees "OPA unreachable" as a warning rather than a hard error so
    editing remains possible during cluster maintenance.

# ── Real OPA simulate (Phase 3) ──────────────────────────────────────────────
#
# The mock path below was useful for Phase 1/2 demos but it has two problems
# operators feel as soon as they start editing real policies:
#
#   1. A policy edit doesn't change the simulator's behaviour. The mock
#      branches on policy.type and hardcoded patterns; the actual Rego the
#      operator just edited is ignored. Editing a regex in jailbreak_policy
#      and clicking Simulate gives the same "allow / block" verdict as
#      before the edit.
#   2. New policy types ship without simulator support. The mock has a
#      type-by-type if/elif tree; anything outside the known set falls
#      through to a generic "allow".
#
# Phase 3 fixes both by evaluating the live Rego against the input via
# OPA's data API:
#   * PUT /v1/policies/_simulate_<rand>      — upload the current logic_code
#   * POST /v1/data/<package>?input=...      — evaluate the package
#   * DELETE /v1/policies/_simulate_<rand>   — clean up
#
# OPA's verdict is taken at face value: any rule in the package that
# returns ``true`` (e.g. ``allow``, ``deny``, ``block``) is reported, and
# we pick the most authoritative one for the SimulateResponse.decision
# field. The full data-API result object is included in
# ``SimulateResponse.details`` so operators can see every rule's value
# without having to reason about which one is "the answer".

    Simulate a policy against a sample input.

    pipeline=False (default): evaluate THIS policy's Rego in isolation
    via OPA's data API.  Used for tuning a single rule — operators see
    their unsaved edits reflected in the verdict.

    pipeline=True: evaluate the full prompt-safety pipeline (the
    ``spm.prompt.allow`` entrypoint) against the input.  This is the
    verdict the actual runtime API would issue, transitively running the
    input-side guards (recon_guard, tool_injection_guard) before the

    input WOULD BE BLOCKED IN PROD, not whether one specific policy
    fires on it.

    Both paths fall through to a deterministic mock when OPA is
    unreachable, so the UI keeps working during cluster maintenance.
